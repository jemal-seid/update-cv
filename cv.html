        <p>I am a development agent in plant science by profession. I have worked particularly hard to spread agricultural technology that boost crop yield and productivity in rural communities. I enjoy spending the majority of my time resolving
          people's issues. I believe this is the reason I decided to work as an agricultural development agent. Another example of this is my intention to get a degree in community health. My life's mission is to support those who are in need. "No
          matter how strong you are, two is always better than one," is a proverb that is well-known in our nation. As a result, I think it's crucial that my coworkers and I work cooperatively. This is something I've developed through the course of
          my many years of teamwork.</p>

        community health extension services. This is implied by my 3.37 overall CGPA. I think that by simply altering our nutrition and leading a healthy lifestyle, we may prevent non-communicable diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular
        diseases, etc., which are rapidly becoming more prevalent in our community and throughout the world.</td>

        conservation, and fodder development, among other things. I have won incentive awards several times because of my hard work and efficiency.</td>

        the countryside during my first few months of employment was quite significant. Of course, I think it's crucial to integrate current science with the farmer's inherent experience and knowledge, but I also think it's critical to value the
        farmer's traditional knowledge and skills.</td>
